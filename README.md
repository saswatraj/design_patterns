# Design Patterns

## Creational Patterns
In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
* [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/saswatraj/design_patterns/blob/master/AbstractFactoryPattern/abstractfactory.md#abstract-factory-pattern)
* [Builder Pattern](https://github.com/saswatraj/design_patterns/blob/master/BuilderPattern/builder.md#builder-pattern)
* [Factory Pattern](https://github.com/saswatraj/design_patterns/blob/master/FactoryPattern/factory.md#factory-method-pattern)
* [Prototype Pattern](https://github.com/saswatraj/design_patterns/blob/master/PrototypePattern/prototype.md#prototype-pattern)
* [Singleton Pattern](https://github.com/saswatraj/design_patterns/blob/master/SingletonPattern/singleton.md#singleton-pattern)

## Structural Patterns
Structural Design Patterns are Design Patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
They are concerned about how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
